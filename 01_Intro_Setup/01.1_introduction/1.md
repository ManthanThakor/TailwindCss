# What is Tailwind css? 

- Tailwind CSS is a highly customizable, utility-first CSS framework designed to streamline the process of building modern web interfaces. 
- Unlike traditional CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Foundation, which provide predefined components, Tailwind focuses on providing low-level utility classes that allow developers to build custom designs without leaving their HTML.
